# RubyNewbieProjects
As a beginner Rubist, I put here the projects I've done while learning the language. 

#### Rock Paper Scissors 
* Description: The user should enter rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer will choose a random value. After each turn display the score (user wins vs. computer wins). Whichever player reaches five wins first is the winner. 

#### Build a Quiz 
* Description: The program gets a few inputs from the user including: number of questions, questions, answers. Then clear the screen and begin the quiz. Keep score!
* Mode: Flash Card Mode and Multiple Choice Mode

#### Tournament Generator
* Description: Help match up teams for the first round of a seed-based tournament. In a seeded tournament, and during the first round, the top seed is matched with the bottom seed, the 2nd highest team is matched with the second lowest, etc. If an odd number of teams are entered, the top-seeded team gets a bye (doesn't play).

#### Grocery Store Helper
* Description: The program should allow the manager to do following tasks: 
(1) View Categories of products
(2) View an individual product (Each product should have the base properties of: name, quantity, serial number, cost, sell price, sell by date.)
(3) Change the quantity of a product
(4) Add products to any category
(5) List out the products that need to be sold within the week
(6) Determine how much each product cost the store to purchase, how much it could bring in in revenue and how much it could make in profit
(7) Put an item on sale, or take an item off sale. Determine the sale discount.
